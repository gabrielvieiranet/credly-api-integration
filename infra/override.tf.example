# LocalStack Provider Override
# This file is used for local development with LocalStack
# It overrides the default AWS provider configuration
#
# To use:
# 1. Copy this file to `override.tf` (which is gitignored)
# 2. Adjust endpoints if needed for your LocalStack setup
#
# Note: Use LOCALSTACK_ENDPOINT environment variable to override the default
# Example: export LOCALSTACK_ENDPOINT="http://192.168.1.100:4566"
